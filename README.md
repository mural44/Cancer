# Cancer Dataset Dashboard Project



---

## Project Overview
This project uses a t to create an Cancer  interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing various health indicators and patient risk levels. The goal is to derive insights into patient health patterns and identify potential correlations between lifestyle factors and medical risk levels.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on various health indicators, lifestyle factors, and symptoms for patients. Key columns include:
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **Age**: Patient's age
- **Gender**: Patient's gender
- **Health Indicators**: Factors such as `Air Pollution`, `Alcohol Use`, `Dust Allergy`, `Genetic Risk`, `Chronic Lung Disease`, etc.
- **Symptoms**: `Chest Pain`, `Coughing of Blood`, `Tiredness`, `Frequent Cold`, etc.
- **Risk Level**: A categorical field (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) indicating the overall health risk level of the patient.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. Identify patterns in health indicators, symptoms, and risk levels.
2. Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights from the dataset.
3. Provide interactive features to explore data by gender, age, risk level, and symptoms.

## Power BI Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
1. **Gender Distribution by Risk Level**: A bar chart showing the distribution of patients by gender across different risk levels.
2. **Age Distribution by Risk Level**: A stacked column chart displaying age categories for each risk level.
3. **Balanced Diet vs. Risk Level**: A line and clustered column chart showing average balanced diet scores across risk levels.
4. **Frequent Cold by Risk Level**: A chart showing the average occurrence of frequent colds across risk levels.
5. **Top Symptoms for High-Risk Patients**: A bar chart highlighting the most common symptoms in high-risk patients.

## Analysis and Insights
This dashboard allows users to derive meaningful insights, such as:
- **Risk Level by Gender**: Identify which gender is more prevalent in each risk category.
- **Age and Risk Correlation**: Analyze if older patients tend to have higher risk levels.
- **Diet and Health Risk**: Determine if patients with balanced diets are less likely to fall into high-risk categories.
- **Frequent Cold and Risk Patterns**: Observe if frequent colds are more common in any specific risk level.
- **Common Symptoms in High-Risk Patients**: Recognize symptoms frequently reported by high-risk patients, helping to identify critical health concerns.
